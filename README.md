# Smart.Calculator
This Java program is a versatile calculator with variable assignment and mathematical expression evaluation capabilities. Here's an overview of its functionality and the Java concepts applied:

Functionality:

Variable Assignment:

You can assign variables using the format variableName = value.
Supports both integers and BigInteger values.
Handles variable names and assignments according to naming rules.
Mathematical Expressions:

Enter mathematical expressions with +, -, *, /, and parentheses.
Utilizes proper operator precedence in calculations.
Supports very large integer calculations with BigInteger.
Command-Line Interface:

Provides a command-line interface for user interaction.
Enter expressions, variable assignments, and commands.
Commands:

/help: Displays program instructions.
/exit: Quits the calculator.
Applied Java Concepts:

Regular Expressions:

Java's Pattern and Matcher classes are used for pattern matching in input validation.
Data Structures:

HashMap is used to store and manage variables, differentiating between integers and BigInteger.
Input/Output:

User input is obtained via Scanner, and output is displayed in the console.
Control Flow:

Control structures like if, while, and for loops manage user input and program execution.
Error Handling:

Exception handling (e.g., NumberFormatException) addresses invalid input and calculations.
BigInteger Arithmetic:

Demonstrates precise arithmetic with the BigInteger class, enabling calculations with large integers.
String Manipulation:

String operations include whitespace removal, splitting, and substitution for variable values.
Expression Evaluation:

Converts infix expressions to postfix notation for accurate mathematical evaluations.
Command-Line Interaction:

Offers a user-friendly command-line interface for seamless interaction.
Usage:

Run the program.
Enter mathematical expressions or variable assignments.
Type /help for instructions and /exit to quit.
Enjoy a versatile and precise calculator in the Java console!
